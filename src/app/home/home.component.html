      <p>
        <strong>Surveilance is a weapon as old as politics.</strong>
        <br />
        From the Gestapo to GCHQ, those in power have always used covert means
        to suppress dissent and maintain power.
        <br />
        Since the dawn of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, the rampant growth of the
        tech industry has driven digital technology into every aspect of our
        lives.
        <br />
        For profit and for power, corporate and state interests make it ever
        harder to escape the ever-present eyes watching us all.
      </p>

      <h3>Power</h3>
      <p>
        CCTV and automatic number-plate recognition already dominate our urban
        centres, while facial recognition without consent of those recorded is
        becoming commonplace in public spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it has been claimed that such methods are heaviest used in areas
        with high crime rates, it appears in actuality they are most often used
        against low-income populations of ethnic minortity and migrant
        background as a method of social control, as opposed to the purpose of
        <q>maintaining law and order</q>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the over-policing of marginalised groups, our institutions of
        law enforcement like the police and border control continue to entrench
        systemic racism and perpetuate social inequality; this is
        <strong>especially</strong> when so-called 'AI' methods are deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been shown that AI software used by law enforcement (including
        facial recognition and algorithmic profiling) are guilty of reflecting
        the implicit biases of those who created it; this results in black-box
        algorithms making life-or-death decisions with the same prejudices as
        human operators but without any of the accountability.

    <div class="col-5">
      <h3>Profit</h3>
      <p>
        Tech giants like Google and Facebook track their users across the
        internet, observing and recording each and every minute detail of online
        behaviour, often without the user's awareness or consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collected data is analysed by such 'data-brokers' in order to estimate
        the personal qualities of each user: from restraunt preferences to
        political views, fitness level to income level, even the likelyhood of
        pregency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under surveillance capitalism the business model of these companies
        depends upon commodification of this personal data, up for sale to
        buyers including advertisers, credit agencies, political groups, and
        national governments.
      </p>
      Each buyer hopes to further their agenda using insights gleaned through
      analysis of your data:
      <ul>
        <li>
          a recruiter chooses whether or not to advertise a high-paying job to
          you, on the basis of your gender;
        </li>
        <li>
          your health insurer might decide to increase your premium because of
          information about your lifestyle, and;
        </li>
        <li>
          political groups can target you with disinformation, and even try to
          dissuade you from voting.
        </li>
